# dijkstra-algoritm-visualization
A visualization for Dijsktra's algorithm on Python Tkinter


Algorithm shows the cheapest way between two specified nodes.

Program can import and export `*.pickle` graphs. After the graph was solved, it should be redrawn.
Lines can be reassigned and new nodes can be added, however old nodes can not be deleted or moved.
In order to create a new graph, you should reset the canvas.


## Requirements
* Python 3.9
* Tkinter
