# dijkstra-algoritm-visualization
A visualization for Dijsktra's algorithm on Python Tkinter


Algorithm shows the cheapest way from the first node to the last one by number (sadly, not the one you choose after adding the nodes).

Program can import and export `*.pickle` files. After the graph was solved, it should be reimported or reset and replaced.

However, lines can be reassigned.
